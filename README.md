# Quantum Mastermind

### An implementation of the Buhrmann quantum algorithm for solvind the Mastermind game.

Built using `qiskit` and compatible with the `quantuminspire` API simulators and quantum computers of the [Quantum Inspire](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/) platform by [QuTech](https://qutech.nl/).

Main project files are located in the `src` directory. A demo run of the algorithm is in the `src/logic/Buhrmann.py` file.
